	This will take some time .
	I will some data into .txt files
	So that part2.py can access that data.
	This will save coffecients in Cofficient.txt
	and  Error in Result.txt

2) Execute part2.py:
	python3 part2.py  
	This will read data from 
	files.
	This will plot graph
	for degree 1 to 9.

3) Execute part3.py:
	python3 part3.py
	This part will also 
	take some time.
	This will save some data into 
	.txt plot .
	So that part3_plot.py can access it.
	This will save cofficient in Lasso.txt
	and Ridge.txt.
	And Error in Result_lasso.txt and Result_ridge.txt.

4)	Execute part3_plot.py:
	python3 part3_plot.py
